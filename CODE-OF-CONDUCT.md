# Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct

We want to keep the Puppet communities awesome, and we need your help to keep it that way. While we have specific guidelines for various tools (see links below), in general, you should:

* **Be nice**: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, doxxing, or unwelcome sexual attention will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!
* **Encourage diversity and participation**: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
* **Focus on constructive criticisms**: When offering suggestions, whether in online discussions or as comments on a pull request, you should always use welcoming and inclusive language. Be respectful of differing viewpoints and the fact that others may not have the same experiences you do. Offer suggestions for improvement, rather than focusing on mistakes. When others critique your work or ideas, gracefully accept the criticisms and default to assuming good intentions.
* **Keep it legal**: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.
* **Stay on topic**: Keep conversation in a thread on topic, whether that's a pull request or a Slack conversation or anything else. Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and remember that nobody likes spam.

## Guideline violations --- 3 strikes method

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we do need a fair way to deal with people who do harm to our community. Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive, or illegal nature will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes.

* First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public, reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
* Second occurrence: We'll send you a private message with a warning that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
* Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we might need to delete or ban your account.

Notes:

* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don’t do this, we’ll have spam all over the place.
* Violations are forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won’t hold a grudge.
* People who are committing minor formatting / style infractions will get some education, rather than hammering them in the 3 strikes process.

Contact conduct@puppet.com to report abuse or appeal violations. This email list goes to Kara Sowles (kara at puppet.com) and Katie Abbott (katie dot abbott at
puppet.com). In the case of appeals, we know that mistakes happen, and we’ll work with you to come up with a fair solution if there has been a misunderstanding.

### Getting technical help

Filing an issue in the GitHub repo is the best way to seek out technical help.

### Issue guidelines

You can log issue and bug reports for Wash by filing issues against [the repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/wash/issues).

Here are a few guidelines that apply specifically to filing issues:

- Each report is for only one issue. If you find several issues, please separate them into several reports.
- Search before you file an issue, and try to avoid filing duplicates by taking a look at whether your issue has already been filed before.
- Don't start debates on topics not directly related to the scope of a specific issue. Create another issue.
- Remove unnecessary lines when quoting other comments.
- Please double check to make sure that the information you are including is public (not confidential), especially in attached log files or screenshots.

### Git / source guidelines

- If you want to contribute code, start with a discussion on a pull request or issue to make sure that what you want to submit is a good idea and architected in a way that will be useful for others.
- Look at existing pull requests and issues to make sure that you aren’t duplicating effort.
- Review any existing CONTRIBUTOR.MD files associated with the project.
- If you are new to git or GitHub, you might find these resources useful: [GitHub help files](http://help.github.com/), [Git cheat sheets](http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/), and [Git Reference documentation](http://gitref.org/).
